      Outdoor activities can be fun for all ages.  Going to the playground at a local park is a great way to help young children develop physically by climbing, running, and jumping.  While pushing a child on the swing talk about how the force of momentum work.  Talk about gravity when playing with ball.

    Reading to a young child can be a wonderful adventure.  Picking an age appropriate book is key.  Books with lots of pictures will help spark the child's imagination.  When reading picture books to toddlers discuss each picture pointing out the different colors, animals, and objects on each page.  Story books tell a story. For instance,  After reading the story 'Jack and the Beanstalk" ask the child questions about story like What happened to the beans? or What did jack get after he claimed the beanstalk? You can also reenact scenes from the story like climbing the beanstalk, going to the market, or chopping down the beanstalk.

    Talk about the color and shape of food packages, is it round, square or rectangle in shape.  Have the child count a number of grapes and  put them into a bag for a snack later.  Use the scales in the produce section of the store to weigh items.  Compare the amount of items vs the weight like 3 apples vs 3 lemons and talk about which heavier or lighter.  Talk about the different prices of the foods they like to eat.  Make homemade cookies to introduce measuring. Add food coloring to milk to see what happens. Everyday cooking can be fun with a little helper by your side.
